Last summer I did some work with my friend and colleague Josie Kressner applying
our data-driven model to potential AV scenarios. I wrote this up over at the
[Transport Foundry blog](https://transportfoundry.com/blog) in a series of three
posts:

  - [Modeling autonomous vehicles with passive data](https://transportfoundry.com/blog/2017/6/6/modeling-autonomous-vehicles-with-passive-data)
  - [Modeling shared autonomous vehicles](https://transportfoundry.com/blog/2017/6/23/modeling-shared-automated-vehicles)
  - [Modeling private autonomous vehicles](https://transportfoundry.com/blog/2017/10/30/modeling-private-autonomous-vehicles)
