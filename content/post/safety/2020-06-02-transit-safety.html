<p>I came across this graphic from an
<a href="https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/resources/statistics/Documents/FactBook/APTA_2011_Fact_Book.pdf">APTA Factbook</a>(p. 20)
which shows transit with an enormous safety advantage over automobiles. I was
curious if I could update the data using information from the Bureau of Transportation
Statistics.</p>

<h2>Passenger Miles</h2>
<p>First, we want to get passenger miles traveled by different modes. The BTS
has this data in an Excel spreadsheet at
<a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/us-passenger-miles">https://www.bts.gov/content/us-passenger-miles</a>.
The data in the spreadsheet is somewhat spotty, and there are <em>plenty</em> of footnotes
describing the fact that the sources of the different elements have
changed over the years. But let’s go with just data from 2000 onward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to read the Excel files directly from the BTS website, but there was
just too much cleaning that needed to be done to make them machine-readable in a
nice way. You can find the lightly modified spreadsheet I used, including a
separate analysis from this one, <a href="/files/passmiles.xlsx">here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="r"><code># get Excel file from BTS

<h2>Fatalities by Mode</h2>
<p>The BTS also publishes statistics on fatality broken up by mode at: <a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/transportation-fatalities-modea">https://www.bts.gov/content/transportation-fatalities-modea</a>. However, there are a number of potential issues
arising from these data. First, transit fatalities are grouped by workers and
vehicle occupants, but are not separated by mode. Additionally, there are a
number of redundant categories.</p>

<p>From my understanding, if a light rail train hits a pedestrian, it counts as a
highway fatality <em>and</em> a transit fatality. Given that a large number of the
rail fatalities are due to trespassers and at-grade crossings, this may overstate
the safety to rail <em>passengers</em>. Also, it double-counts fatalities resulting from
a commuter rail train colliding with a private automobile.</p>
<p>My thoughs on the APTA chart:</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe they used Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) instead of passenger miles traveled.
Because the average occupancy of a vehicle is somewhat over 1.0, this overstates
the relative danger of highway modes.</li>
<li>I believe they considered only fatalities among <em>transit passengers</em> resulting
from <em>train crashes</em>, and did not include fatalities among transit workers or
other users killed by trains. I believe they did, however, include all highway
fatalities, and not simply vehicle occupants. You could make the argument that
this is the correct comparison, but I don’t believe that it is fair.</li>
</ul>
