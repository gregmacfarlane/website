Last week the Deseret News ran a contributed
[opinion piece by Andrew Skabelund](https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/8/10/21358753/guest-opinion-utah-county-tech-centric-future-human-natural-resources-silicon-slopes-farming-desert)^[Who was a friend and classmate of mine way back at Wasatch Elementary School!]
